# baby-projects
Smaller baby projects and dumping ground for old class projects

### Current Baby Projects:

**Huffman Encoder** \ C++ \ March 2020
- Uses a basic huffman compression algorithm to encode/decode a text file 

**Terminal-Based Hangman** \ Java \ March 2019
- Kinda ugly implementation of hangman
- I was a baby back then, don't judge me
