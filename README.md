Smaller baby projects and dumping ground for old class projects

### Current Baby Projects:

**Tic-Tac-Toe Regressors** \ Python \ September 2021
- Uses SKLearn's neural networks to train a tic-tac-toe AI (maybe a bit overkill)
- `ttt_classifier.py`: Looks at a tic-tac-toe board in an endgame condition and tries to figure out which player is the winner. Outputs loss for three different types of classifiers.
- `ttt_regressor.py`: Looks at a tic-tac-toe board in intermediate play and predicts what the next best move will be. Outputs loss for three different regressors. A linear regressor is implemented by hand.
- `ttt_game.py`: A playable, terminal-based tic-tac-toe game where your opponent is one of the three previous regressors. 

**Huffman Encoder** \ C++ \ March 2020
- Uses a basic huffman compression algorithm to encode/decode a text file 

**Terminal-Based Hangman** \ Java \ March 2019
- Kinda ugly implementation of hangman
- I was a baby back then, don't judge me
